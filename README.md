# pak
Personal computer vision/deep learning dataset helper toolbox to make it less tedious to download and 
load common datasets.

## Datasets

### MOT16
Dataset[1] with 14 video sequences (7 train, 7 test) in unconstrained environments with both static and
moving cameras. Tracking + evaluation is done in image coordinates.

```python
from pak import datasets
mot16 = datasets.MOT16('/place/to/store/the/data')
# if the library cannot find the data in the given directory it
# will download it and place it there..

X, Y_det, Y_gt  = mot16.get_train_raw("MOT16-02")
X, Y_det        = mot16.get_test_raw("MOT16-01")
```

### 2DMOT2015

Dataset[2] with video sequences in unconstrained environments using static and moving cameras.

```python
from pak import datasets
mot15 = datasets.MOT152D('/place/to/store/the/data')
# if the library cannot find the data in the given directory it
# will download it and place it there..

X, Y_det, Y_gt  = mot15.get_train_raw("ADL-Rundle-6")
X, Y_det        = mot15.get_test_raw("ADL-Rundle-1")
```

### Market-1501
[3]Person re-identitification dataset collected in front of a supermarket from six different cameras. The dataset
contains 1501 different identities that are captured by at least two cameras.

```python
from pak import datasets
mot15 = datasets.Market1501('/place/to/store/the/data')
# if the library cannot find the data in the given directory it
# will download it and place it there..

X, Y = m1501.get_train_raw()
```
